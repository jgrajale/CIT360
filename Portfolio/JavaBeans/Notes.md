# JavaBeans 

* **JavaBeans -** Classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object.
  * One great way of explaining them is by thinking of Java beans as worker assembling a car, for example instead f building a radio from scratch, the worker hooks up the radio to the car. The radio was made in a separate place but it stills works with the car. Java Beans is an object that can work with different code without affecting the other pieces of the code. 
  * A great tool that can be used to build Java Beans is Netbeans, with netbeans we can assemble Java Beans components and then add that code into a different project. 
  * JavaBeans can use software components without having to understand their implementations\
