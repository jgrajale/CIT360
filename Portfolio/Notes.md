# Notes

\
JavaBeans - Classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object. \
\
Serializing - 
An object can be represented as a sequence of bytes that includes the object's data as well as information about the object's type and the types of data stored in the object. \
\
Deserializing - After a serialized object has been written into a file, it can be read from the file and deserialized that is, the type information and bytes that represent the object and its data can be used to recreate the object in memory.
\
Collections - Sometimes called a container — is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.
