# Notes

\
* **JavaBeans -** Classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object.
  * One great way of explaining them is by thinking of Java beans as worker assembling a car, for example instead f building a radio from scratch, the worker hooks up the radio to the car. The radio was made in a separate place but it stills works with the car. Java Beans is an object that can work with different code without affecting the other pieces of the code. 
  * A great tool that can be used to build Java Beans is Netbeans, with netbeans we can assemble Java Beans components and then add that code into a different project. 
  * JavaBeans can use software components without having to understand their implementations\

* **Serializing -**
   * An object can be represented as a sequence of bytes that includes the object's data as well as information about the object's type and the types of data stored in the object. 

* **Deserializing -**
   * After a serialized object has been written into a file, it can be read from the file and deserialized that is, the type information and bytes that represent the object and its data can be used to recreate the object in memory.

* **Collections -** Sometimes called a container â€” is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.

	* Interfaces: These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.
	* Implementations: These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.
	* Algorithms: These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface. In essence, algorithms are reusable functionality.
