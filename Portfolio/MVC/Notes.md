# MVC

* **What is MVC -**
 * MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns. - Also refered as Data Interface Coordinator.

 * Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.

 * View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.

 * Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.
