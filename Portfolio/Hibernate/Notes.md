#  Hibernate

* **Hibernate -** Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the work in persisting those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns. High performance Object-Relational Persistence and Query service for any Java Application.

	*  Hibernate takes care of mapping Java classes to database tables using XML files and without writing any line of code.
	*  Provides simple APIs for storing and retrieving Java objects directly to and from the database.
	*  If there is change in Database or in any table then the only need to change XML file properties.
	*  Minimize database access with smart fetching strategies.
	*  Provides Simple querying of data.
	*  The Hibernate architecture is layered to keep you isolated from having to know the underlying APIs. Hibernate makes use of the database and configuration data to provide persistence services (and persistent objects) to the application.

* **Hibernate onjects**

   *  Configuration Object -  It represents a configuration or properties file required by the Hibernate. The Configuration object provides two keys components: Database Connections and Class Mapping Setup
