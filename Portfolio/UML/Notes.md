# Use Case Diagrams

* **What are Use Case Diagrams -**
 * Use cases provide significantly more value because they describe "the meat" of the actual requirements. They describes a sequence of actions that provide something of measurable value to an actor and is drawn as a horizontal ellipse.

 * Actors - An actor is a person, organization, or external system that plays a role in one or more interactions with your system. Actors are drawn as stick figures. 

 * Associations - Associations between actors and use cases are indicated in use case diagrams by solid lines. An association exists whenever an actor is involved with an interaction described by a use case. Associations are modeled as lines connecting use cases and actors to one another, with an optional arrowhead on one end of the line. The arrowhead is often used to indicating the direction of the initial invocation of the relationship or to indicate the primary actor within the use case. 

 * System boundary boxes - You can draw a rectangle around the use cases, called the system boundary box, to indicates the scope of your system. Anything within the box represents functionality that is in scope and anything outside the box is not. System boundary boxes are rarely used, although on occasion you can used them to identify which use cases will be delivered in each major release of a system. 

 * Packages - Packages are UML constructs that enable you to organize model elements (such as use cases) into groups. Packages are depicted as file folders and can be used on any of the UML diagrams, including both use case diagrams and class diagrams.
