#  JUnit

Last Update: 3/15

* **What is JUnit -**
   * JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively known as xUnit that originated with SUnit.
   * JUnit is linked as a JAR at compile-time; the framework resides under package junit.framework. 

* **Why JUnit? -**
   * JUnit allows the developer to incrementally build test suites to measure progress and detect unintended side effects. Tests can be run continuously. Results are provided immediately. JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is normally green but turns red when a test fails.
   * You should write JUnit tests in any case for the critical and complex parts of an application.

 * **Eclipse Help -**
 	* When looking for steps on creating a JUnit test, Eclipse offers the developer a great tutorial on how to write and run a JUnit test, to look at these steps you can go to help>help contents and type JUnit. 

 	* In this folder there is a sample code that can help us see JUnit in action. My sharing video is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA19r8sKar8
