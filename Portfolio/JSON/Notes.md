# JSON 

* **JSON -** JavaScript Object Notation. A way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.

  * By enclosing the variable’s value in curly braces, we’re indicating that the value is an object. Inside the object, we can declare any number of properties using a "name": "value" pairing, separated by commas
  * To access information in JSON we type document.write(name.value);
